Activity recognizer using data mining and machine learning algorithms

# DATASETS ARE NOT PRESENT
due to high dimension.
The dataset used was A_DeviceMotion_data, found on kaggle.
Honor 20 readings are readings extracted on a test phone by myself.
processed_datasets are the ones used in the notebooks, to speed up the computation instead of obtaining them from the raw datasets above.
(Only the last one can be downloaded in order to make the project work.)
